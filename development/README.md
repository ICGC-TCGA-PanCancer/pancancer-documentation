## Development

In order to develop components to go with the PanCancer tool set it is important to have it be incorporated into the full architecture. To do this you will need to push the changes to develop and then, once you are confident in your changes, create a release. At this point the [PanCancer Launcher](https://github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/pancancer_launcher/blob/develop/README.md) should be made to use the newer version of the workflow.

##HubFlow

In all of the PanCancer repos we use [HubFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/) to provide structure to our release process.

##Travis.cl

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is used to check to ensure repositories are passing builds and tests. We are trying to use this technology as much as possible to encure quality of the repositories.
