## Managing an existing Pancancer environment

Some ideas:

  - basic stuff such as how to kill a worker node
  - deploying INI files to existing workers that have already finished their initial workflow
  - trouble-shooting workflow errors (maybe in workflow-specific pages)
  - terminating workers that are having problems
  - monitoring?
