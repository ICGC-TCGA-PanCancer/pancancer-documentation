In order to get the launcher on AWS to provision and schedule jobs to an academic cloud, such as EBI, you will
have to setup a launcher on AWS that you will use for deploying and reaping of nodes and for scheduling work to them.

Because the nodes on the academic clouds do not have public IP address' you will have to create a launcher with in 
the cloud. With this launcher you will spin up one node to create a fully provisioned workflow. 

Academic Launcher
1) on either of the launchers deploy a single node without running ansible
2) Disable the line in the container_host_bag/roles/arch3/tasks/main.yml to not run the worker (so we don't need to do cleanup)
3) From the launcher on the academic cloud provision the machine by running the anble playbook
4) Run ansible from the academic launcher launcher
5) Modify the params.json, on the academic launcher, to reflect a Launcher on Amazon (queue host and sensu host)
6) 
6) Create the snapshot through the OpenStack Dashboard

After the Snapshot has been created create the AWS Launcher:
1) Change security settings on AWS to allow Sensu communication and communication from where you are:
  Inbound
  Port Range      Protocol  IP
  5671-5672       tcp   193.62.54.0/24 (Sensu ports and academic IP range)
  
  
2) Modify  ~/.youxia/config by removing the parameters pertaining to running playbooks fo look like this:
    youxia_deployer_parameters=--max-spot-price 0.001 --batch-size 3 --openstack
    youxia_reaper_parameters=--openstack
    
The rest should be the same as spinning up an internal launcher with queueing abilities
