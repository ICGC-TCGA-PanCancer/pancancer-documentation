## About 
This page shows the amount of uploaded data in previous data trains. 

## Collecting the Data
The page gets its data from master spreadsheets that were created shortly after each freeze. The spreadsheets that are currently being used are:

    Data Freeze 1.0 Report: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14NItsHKJUevHZIuFkFTwNF-C12WbXTrFe0oM0Xq6b4M/edit#gid=111470950
    Data Freeze 2.0 Report: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X3ZO3SIRm7emv3F5jCU116EprDWJnRGNqCB8x5HqOws/edit?usp=drive_web
    
These master spreadsheets provide all the data from each freeze and is used to make all the tables and charts on the page.
