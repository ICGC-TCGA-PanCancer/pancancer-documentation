## About
This page shows the specimens uploaded for every project. The first table shows aggregates the ICGC projects by city and puts all the TCGA projects together in one column. It shows the totals and percentages of all sites as well. Below the table are two charts which show the percentage and uploaded specimens each day/week. This is a good way to see the progress of each city. There are also options to view everything by the associated repo for both charts.
