#PanCancer Documentation

This repository contains all of the necessary documents for working with the PanCancer tools.

For an overview of how the different pieces fit together, see the [Overview page](Overview.md).

##Production

If you are running the PanCancer tools in a production environment, you will probably be primarily interested in the [Production pages](production/README.md#production)

##Development

If you are a developer who is developing new workflows, or if you are a developer who needs to make changes to parts of the Pancancer infrastructure such as Youxia, pancancer-bag, seqware-bag, or container-host-bag, you will want to read more in the [Developer pages](development/README.md)
