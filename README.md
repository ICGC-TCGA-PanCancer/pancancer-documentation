pancancer-documentation
=======================

This repository contains all of the necessary documents for working with the pancancer tools.

If you are running the pancancer tools in a production environment, you will probably be primarily interested in the [Production pages](production/prodution.md#production)

If you are a developer who is developing new workflows, or if you are a developer who needs to make changes to parts of the Pancancer infrastructure such as Bindle, pancancer-bag, seqware-bag, or container-host-bag, you will want to read more in the [Developer pages](development/development.md)
